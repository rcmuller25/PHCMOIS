   ``` Security Considerations
1. Data Encryption
   
   - All sensitive patient data is encrypted using XOR encryption with SHA-256 hash
   - Security levels can be configured based on deployment requirements
   - Encryption key management should be reviewed for production deployments
2. Authentication
   
   - The application supports secure authentication
   - Inactivity timeout can be configured
   - Authentication is required for accessing sensitive data
3. Offline Security
   
   - Data remains encrypted even in offline mode
   - Security settings persist across application restarts Performance Optimization
1. Theme Calculations
   
   - Pre-computed themes to avoid recalculation
   - Memoized style objects
   - Platform-specific optimizations
2. Component Rendering
   
   - Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Optimized list rendering
   - Lazy loading for complex screens
3. Data Management
